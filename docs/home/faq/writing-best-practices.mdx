# Style Guide for Helium Docs (docs.helium.com)

This is a collection of agreed upon dos and don'ts for pages on Helium Docs that should be used
during process of creating new pages or editing already existing ones. It serves as a reference for
maintaining consistency, clarity, and professionalism across all technical documentation related to
the Helium Network.

## Titles

Use descriptive, short titles that are no longer than 4 words. 

## Visual Assets

### Diagrams and Illustrations

Use visual aids such as diagrams, flowcharts where needed to enhance understanding of complex
technical concepts, processes and network schemas.

### Images / Screenshots

- Include alternative text to describe what is visible on the image.

- Include screenshots of relevant interfaces or platforms to provide visual context for users
following instructions or guides. For example: when dealing with interface tutorials, provide
screenshot after each step.

Do: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Include screenshots with relevant step for a given process  
Don't: &nbsp;Add screenshots with information irrelevant to current page

Do: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use screenshots with same image ratio and high resolution.
Edit screenshot in app before including them if needed  
Don't: &nbsp;Include weairdly cropped screenshots with inconsistent ratio or low resolution

## Acronyms

When using it for the first time, include the term, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Then
use just the acronym for following mentions.

Example:

> Hotspots enable people to own and operate a wireless network that supports a wide range of Internet
of Things (IoT) devices.

## Code

Use codeblocks to showcase any technical examples. All snippets should be copied exactly as they
appear in the code without any additional changes. Use the matching language meta string for your
code block, and Docusaurus will pick up syntax highlighting automatically.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="alert-code"
  values={[
    {label: 'Code', value: 'alert-code'},
    {label: 'Example', value: 'alert-example'},
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="alert-code" label="Code">
    <CodeBlock
        language="jsx"
        title="/sidebarDocs.js"
        >
          {`home: [
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Home',
      link: { type: 'doc', id: 'home/home' },
      items: ['home/about-helium', 'home/helium-history'],
    },
  ],`}
</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="alert-example" label="Example">
  <div>
    ```jsx
    <CodeBlock
        language="jsx"
        title="/sidebarDocs.js"
        >
          {`home: [
            {
              type: 'category',
              label: 'Home',
              link: { type: 'doc', id: 'home/home' },
              items: ['home/about-helium', 'home/helium-history'],
            },
          ],`}
        </CodeBlock>
        ```
      </div>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Technical terms

### Use Examples

- When dealing with novel technical terms, simplify concepts, use examples where possible

| Recommended | Example                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✔️          | _"A quorum of tokens represented must be met to certify the proposal as a valid outcome. The quorum is 100,000,000 tokens represented at the time of the vote in the vote results. This quorum is equal across the Network and all subNetworks. If a proposal does not reach this quorum, the proposal will automatically fail. Even if the proposal received a 66% super majority of Voting Power, the proposal did not reach quorum and therefore is invalidated."_ |
| ❌          | _"A quorum of tokens for a valid outcome."_                                      |

### Consistency

- Maintain consistency in formatting, language, and terminology throughout the documentation.

- Use the same naming conventions for tokens, protocols, and components across all sections.

### Governance related

#### "Locking / Delegating" vs. "Staking"

- When talking about token lock-up and delegation of tokens, use the specific terms "locking" and
  "delegating" where applicable.
- Avoid referring to any of those solely as "staking".

| Recommended | Example                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✔️          | _"To earn MOBILE token rewards: (1.) Lock HNT (2.) Delegate the veHNT position to the Mobile Subnetwork"_ |
| ❌          | _"To earn MOBILE token rewards: Stake HNT in the Mobile Subnetwork"_                                      |

# Alerts

Alerts add additional context to information. Admonitions from Docusaurus can be used to indicate
the alert is a Note, Caution, or a Tip. The types that are accepted are as follows: note, tip,
danger, info, warning.

<Tabs
  defaultValue="alert-code"
  values={[
    {label: 'Code', value: 'alert-code'},
    {label: 'Example', value: 'alert-example'},
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="alert-code" label="Code">
    ```Rust
      :::warning

      Only certified CBRS Radios provisioned with the FreedomFi firmware will operate when connected to a 5G Hotspot.

      CBRS Radios that are not certified and do not use the FreedomFi firmware will not provide 5G coverage and will not mine MOBILE.

      :::
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="alert-example" label="Example">
  <div>
    <Admonition type="warning">
        <p>
          Only certified CBRS Radios provisioned with the FreedomFi firmware will operate when connected to a 5G Hotspot.
        </p>
      </Admonition>
      </div>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
