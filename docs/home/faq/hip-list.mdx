This list contains note-worthy HIPs that passed the voting along with short, 
easy-to-understand summary of what the HIP is about. While HIPs are in discussion, they are included
in the [Helium HIP Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/helium/hip).

## HIP Overview

- **HIP-0-template** - Template for creating new HIPs.
- **HIP-1-longfi-and-lorawan** - This proposal includes initial implementation of LongFi on LoRaWAN by leveraging LoRaWAN's existing features.
-**HIP-2-sign-miner** - This is a proposal to separate Helium's blockchain software from the rest of the Hotspot firmware image in order to
  make a stronger case for decentralized nature of the Helium Network. Reliance on one or more independent signatories allows the network to
  grow in a truly decentralized fashion, eventually moving control of how the network develops away from any single entity and into the hands
  of the network stakeholders themselves.
-**HIP-3-miner-update.md** - This proposal examines how Helium could allow consumer Hotspot owners to specify and deliver their own over-the-air
  miner updates. The scope of this proposal excludes do-it-yourself Hotspots which Helium is under no obligation to support. It also excludes
  the non-miner-related bits of the Hotspot firmware image which Helium will solely continue to update using our existing nextgate/nexthaul
  client-server mechanism.
-**HIP-4-expensing-data-credits-for-lorawan** - The proposal's goal is streamlining data credit expenses for LoRaWAN traffic by charging a
  fixed rate for each 24 bytes used, simplifying the user experience. It suggests charging for specific data components while ensuring minimal
  charge for essential packet types. This approach aims to strike a balance between fairness for both users and operators by offering a
  straightforward way to estimate costs while preventing exploitation of the system.
-**HIP-5-poc-fairness** - The proposal addresses the concentration of rewards in proof of coverage challenges among top Hotspots in the
  Helium Network by suggesting a cap on the number of challenges a single Hotspot can participate in during an Epoch.
