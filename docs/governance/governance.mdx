## What is Helium Governance?

Helium governance exists to manage the process by which the network can be modified, whether in its
technical architecture, the token's economic model, or meta-governance changes. It is governed by
the global community of owners of Helium tokens ([HNT](/tokens/hnt-token),
[MOBILE](/tokens/mobile-token), or [IOT](/tokens/iot-token)). These token owners include Hotspot
deployers, network users, wireless network operators, hardware manufacturers, and more. Tokens must
be locked for voting on network changes, ensuring long-term stakeholder alignment.

Anyone can submit a Helium Improvement Proposal ([HIP](/governance/hip)) as a first step to
modifying the network. All HIPs are published in the public Helium GitHub repository, then discussed
and debated in public forums, including the Helium community Discord server, and on monthly
community calls. Any Helium token owner is eligible to vote on HIPs within the domain of that
specific token. To vote, a Helium token owner must first lock their tokens for a period of time, up
to four years, which grants the owner voting power determined by the number of locked tokens and the
lock duration.

As Helium is a network of networks, there are currently three different jurisdictions for
governance:

1. Locking HNT allows for voting on HIPs governing the <u>Helium network as a whole</u>.
1. Locking IOT enables voting on HIPs governing the <u>IoT subnetwork</u>.
1. Locking MOBILE enables voting on HIPs governing the <u>mobile subnetwork</u>.

The Helium Foundation serves as a steward for the governance process. The Foundation established the
initial framework and manages the open Helium GitHub repositories. The Foundation does not vote on
HIPs but does vet proposals for compliance with the law and technical feasibility. The Foundation's
role is to provide expert advice and guidance and to guide implementation of the HIPs after they
have passed.

Information about governance is subject to change as the Helium Network constantly evolves. It is
led by the open-source community that continues to build it.

## Security

The Helium implementation on Solana has circuit breakers in place to prevent exploits to the smart
contracts. These circuit breakers act as a protection mechanism to protect the Helium network and
limit the impact of potential exploits. The circuit breakers will be adjustable by the multisig and
through the governance process. They may limit legitimate use but we feel that the security benefits
outweigh the drawbacks. We propose several different circuit breakers that are outlined below: 

1. **Mint Circuit Breakers**: The Mint Circuit Breakers protect the issuance of new tokens. We
propose that the circuit breaker does not allow more than 5x the epoch amount be minted within a
single 24h period. Because epoch rewards are automated by Clockwork there should never be a day in
which more than the normal epoch amount is emitted. The initial value of 5 allows bugs to process
emissions that might be backed up by a bug. There are three Mint Circuit Breakers, one for HNT, one
for MOBILE and one for IOT token.

2. **Reward Pool Circuit Breaker**: The Reward Pool Circuit Breaker protect the reward pool accounts.
Tokens that are minted will wait in the reward pool account until the hotspots owner claims the
rewards. We propose that the circuit breaker does not allow more than 5x the epoch amount to be
claimed from the reward pool account. The drawback of this limit is that a large deployer claiming a
large number of tokens might trigger the circuit breaker. There will initially be two Reward Pool
Circuit Breakers, one for MOBILE and one for IOT token.

3. **Treasury Circuit Breakers**: The Treasury Circuit Breakers protect the subDAO treasuries. The
subDAO treasuries allow DNT tokens to be redeemed for HNT. We propose that the circuit breaker will
allow a maximum of 20% of the treasury to be redeemed in every 24-hour period. Currently there are
two Treasury Circuit Breakers, one for MOBILE and one for IOT token.

### Multisig Authority

Multisig update authority is currenyly held by Helium Foundation in order to make changes and/or
upgrades to the Solana programs quickly if there are any bugs or faults uncovered. As the programs
mature and stabilize these upgrades will become less time sensitive and this will allow the multisig
to be expanded to include the Helium DAO or an elected council.

governance, including specific HIPs, voting procedures, and working groups. Refer to the provided
links and resources.

1. **Discord**: The [Helium Discord](https://discord.gg/helium) platform serves as the primary
   communication channel for the Helium Network Community. It offers real-time discussions, support,
   and engagement opportunities.
2. **GitHub Repository**: The [HIP GitHub](https://github.com/helium/HIP) repository provides access
   to the Helium Improvement Proposals and related discussions.
3. **Social Media and Ecosystem Voices**: The Helium Foundation and various influencers on platforms
   like Twitter, Discord, and YouTube provide updates, debates, and explanations of HIPs and
   governance-related matters.
4. **Monthly Community Calls**: The Helium Community holds monthly video calls (led by the Helium
   Foundation). These typically happen on the 4th Wednesday of each month at Noon ET. Each call has
   an [open agenda](https://www.helium.foundation/community-call), and any community member can join
   and add items to the agenda to be discussed.
5. **Community Calendar**: The Helium Foundation maintains a calendar of ecosystem events and
   happenings. You can access and subscribe at:
   [www.helium.foundation/community-calendar](https://www.helium.foundation/community-calendar).

### Socials + Ecosystem Voices

As a network steward, the Helium Foundation posts important governance news, calls to vote, and more
on Twitter. [Follow @HeliumFndn](https://twitter.com/HeliumFndn) on Twitter to stay up to date.

As a decentralized network, numerous voices discuss governance, host debates, and explain HIPs in
layman's terms. You can find many of these influential voices in Discord, on Twitter, or on YouTube.
