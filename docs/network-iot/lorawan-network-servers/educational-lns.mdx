## Unrewarded Trial Network

[HIP-102](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0102-helium-educational-lns.md) proposes the
implementation of a dedicated LoRaWAN Network Server ([LNS](/iot/lorawan-network-servers)) tailored
for educational and trial usage in the Helium IoT Network. Operating under the Helium Foundation's
Type 6 NetID (0xC00053), distinctly separate from OUIs issued using the Type 0 NetID. This LNS offers free data transfer services for educational, trial, and
experimental purposes, with the crucial distinction that these transfers will not yield rewards for
Hotspots, to ensure the network's integrit. 

The initiative aims to foster learning and experimentation within the Helium IoT Network while
maintaining its economic stability. By introducing a specialized LNS under a designated NetID, users
can engage in educational and trial activities without risking exploitation of the main network. This
approach seeks to balance the need for an open, accessible learning environment with the maintenance
of the economic and operational stability of the main Helium Network.

### Safety Measures

In addition, the LNS will be set up with specific operational rules to further safeguard network
operations. Initially, devices will be allowed to operate on the LNS for one day. Following this,
they will be automatically removed and blocked from the service for one week. This measure is designed
to prevent continuous use of the network by a single user or device, thereby discouraging attempts
to use this free service to exploit network coverage available on Helium. It also reinforces the
utility of the Helium network for deployment-based use cases.

The presence of a closely managed free route in the ecosystem introduces numerous opportunities
including but not limited to: interactive educational materials, coverage mapping platforms, and
other initiatives.

Metrics from the OUIs operating on the Foundation Type 6 NetID will all be recorded in Oracle data
stores. As a means to offer transparency to the community, a dashboard will be created to represent
metrics such as the number of distinct devices, traffic metrics, Hotspots used, etc.

### Rationale

We're favoring providing access to developers in the LoRaWAN ecosystem over alternative approaches
like converting Foundation Console into a paid service or leaving educational efforts to third-party
providers.

Past efforts to provide free or zero-profit access have proven to present numerous challenges. We
feel that the passthrough of free data exclusively for trial and educational purposes is the best
design for the long-term success of the network. Not making this change at this time would leave a
void for developers and deployers curious to step into using the network.
