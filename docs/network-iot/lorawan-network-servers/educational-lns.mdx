## Unrewarded Trial Network

[HIP-102](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/main/0102-helium-educational-lns.md) which outlines the
creation of a dedicated LoRaWAN Network Server ([LNS](/iot/lorawan-network-servers)) solely for
educational and trial purposes within the Helium Network. Operating under a distinct NetID (0xC00053),
this LNS offers free data transfer for users to learn and experiment without compromising the
integrity or economic model of the main network.

The initiative aims to encourage learning and experimentation within the Helium IoT Network while
maintaining its economic stability. By introducing a specialized LNS under a designated NetID, users
can engage in educational and trial activities without risking exploitation of the main network. This
approach seeks to balance the need for an open, accessible learning environment with the maintenance
of the economic and operational stability of the main Helium Network.

### Safety Measures

In addition, the LNS will be set up with specific operational rules to further safeguard network
operations. Initially, devices will be allowed to operate on the LNS for one day. Following this,
they will be automatically removed and blocked from the service for one week. This measure is designed
to prevent continuous use of the network by a single user or device, thereby discouraging attempts
to use this free service to exploit network coverage available on Helium. It also reinforces the
utility of the Helium network for deployment-based use cases.

The presence of a closely managed free route in the ecosystem introduces numerous opportunities
including but not limited to: 
- interactive educational materials
- coverage mapping platforms

Metrics from the OUIs operating on the Foundation Type 6 NetID will all be recorded in Oracle data
stores. As a means to offer transparency to the community, a dashboard will be created to represent
metrics such as the number of distinct devices, traffic metrics, Hotspots used, etc.

### Rationale for Chosen Approach

This initiative prioritizes providing accessible learning opportunities for developers within the 
Helium Network ecosystem. We carefully considered alternative approaches such as monetizing the existing 
Foundation Console or relying solely on third-party educational resources. However, past experiences 
with free or non-profit access models revealed significant challenges. 

We firmly believe that offering free data transfer exclusively for educational and trial purposes
is the most effective long-term strategy for the network's success. The aim of this initiative is to
eliminate potential barriers for developers and deployers curious about exploring the capabilities 
of the Helium Network.
